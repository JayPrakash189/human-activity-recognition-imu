1) Human Activity Recognition using IMU Sensor Data

Machine learning analysis of accelerometer (IMU) time-series data for recognizing human motion patterns.

A) Overview
This project analyzes human motion signals captured using accelerometer sensors and applies machine learning techniques to classify activities and identify motion behavior patterns.

B) Work Done
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Random Forest classification (~98% accuracy)
- Feature importance analysis
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- K-Means clustering

C) Results
- High classification accuracy
- Clear motion patterns across activities
- Distinct clustering of activity types

D) Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab
