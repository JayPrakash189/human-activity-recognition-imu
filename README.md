# Human Activity Recognition using IMU Sensor Data

Machine learning analysis of accelerometer (IMU) time-series data for recognizing human motion patterns.

## Overview
This project analyzes human motion signals captured using accelerometer sensors and applies machine learning techniques to classify activities and identify motion behavior patterns.

## Work Done
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Random Forest classification (~98% accuracy)
- Feature importance analysis
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- K-Means clustering

## Results
- High classification accuracy
- Clear motion patterns across activities
- Distinct clustering of activity types

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab
